## Purpose of repository

The purpose of this repo and all the files within it are to map belly button diversity across many subjects to find the right bacteria that can synthesize protien that tastes like beef.

The three files that are powering this website are the index.html, charts.js and samples.json files. Together these files talk to one another to create the interactive webpage!
